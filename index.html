        <p>Hello everyone, my name is Geethika Sunkara, and I'm thrilled to share a bit about myself with all of you. I'm currently navigating the exciting journey of being a student in RV University, and it's a time of both challenges and discoveries. </p>
        <p>Academically, I'm passionate about Web Designing. I find joy in unraveling the complexities of the subject and exploring the world of knowledge. It's not just about getting good grades for me; it's about understanding the intricacies and applying what I learn to the world around me. Beyond the classroom, I'm a Classical Dancer as well. Whether it's painting, engaging in competetions, or delving into creative pursuits, these activities bring balance and joy to my life.</p>
          <p>Friendships and relationships are essential aspects of my college experience. I value the bonds I've formed with my friends, sharing laughter, supporting each other, and creating lasting memories. This journey is not just about academic growth but also about personal development and forging connections. As I navigate the challenges of adolescence, I'm also discovering more about myself â€“ my strengths, interests, and aspirations. The future is a vast, open landscape, and I'm eager to explore the possibilities it holds. </p>
         <p>With a blend of curiosity, determination, and a touch of teenage enthusiasm, I'm ready to embrace whatever comes my way. Thank you for letting me share a glimpse into who I am, and here's to the exciting adventures that the rest of college holds for all of us! .</p>

        <h2>My Passion: Bharatanatyam</h2>
        <p>Bharatanatyam: My Dance Odyssey</p>
           <p>From the tender age of six, Bharatanatyam has been an integral part of my life. Enchanted by the rhythm and grace, I embarked on this dance voyage, finding in its intricate movements and expressive gestures, a language that speaks directly from my soul. Bharatanatyam is not just a hobby for me; it's a big part of who I am. It has taught me how to be disciplined, work hard, and express myself.</p> 
           <p>Every time I dance, I feel proud of this beautiful art form. My journey with Bharatanatyam began with completing the Junior Grade and recently, I reached a new milestone by completing the Senior Grade, both under the Karnataka State Board. Starting from the basics in the Junior Grade, I developed a strong foundation in this beautiful classical dance form. The journey through these grades was filled with learning intricate dance techniques and expressing stories through dance. Each step in this journey has been fulfilling, enhancing my skills and deepening my love for Bharatanatyam. These accomplishments are not just certificates; they represent my dedication, hard work, and the joy I find in Bharatanatyam.</p> 
            
           <p>This is a big step in my journey with this beautiful Indian classical dance form. It was a challenging and rewarding experience where I learned advanced dance techniques and deepened my understanding of Bharatanatyam. I'm proud of this achievement and excited to continue growing and performing as a Bharatanatyam dancer.</p>
